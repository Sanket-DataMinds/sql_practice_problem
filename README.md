## www.sql-practice.com

This repository is dedicated to students and professionals who would like to brush up and advance their SQL skills for their careers. I found (https://www.sql-practice.com) educational and the web site user friendly however there wasnâ€™t the complete solution book shared on the web site neither on GitHub. So now you can get the answers with alternative solutions for each question 

I have used PostgreSQL as main Database Management Systems (DBMS) and therefore you may encounter some queries that work in PostgreSQL may not work in
other DBMS such as SQL Server or MySQL as some implementations slight vary in syntax. For such cases, for example, in date and time operations 
I included standart SQL queries as well.

I populated mockdata using www.mockaroo.com to effectively practise the queries and get some output while working locally. Note that it is not the same large dataset used on the web site, so I suggest you use the web site itself as long as you have internet connection, which is also good for tracking your progress. You may use the sql database files given in the repository for convenience and a rapid start in creating schemas and inserting datasets.

Questions 1- 23

1. Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.

```sql
-- PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(first_name = 'John') = 1;

WHERE allergies IN ('Penicillin', 'Morphine')
ORDER BY allergies,
         first_name,
         last_name;

FROM doctors;
```

11. Show all allergies ordered by popularity. Remove NULL values from query.

WHERE allergies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY allergies
ORDER BY total_diagnosis DESC;
```

12. Show all patient's first_name, last_name, and birth_date who were born in the 1970s decade.
    Sort the list starting from the earliest birth_date.

    - patient_id is an odd number and attending_doctor_id is either 1, 5, or 19.
    - attending_doctor_id contains a 2 and the length of patient_id is 3 characters.

```sql
-- PostgreSQL (we would need to explicity cast the type attending_doctor_id is integer whereas LIKE method performs operations on Strings
SELECT patient_id, attending_doctor_id, diagnosis
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id % 2 = 1 AND attending_doctor_id IN (1, 5, 19)
   OR CONCAT(attending_doctor_id) LIKE '%2%' AND LENGTH(CONCAT(patient_id)) = 3;

```sql

SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) AS number_of_duplicates
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

/*
In the HAVING clause, you can only use the names of columns that are included in the GROUP BY clause 
or that are aggregated by an aggregate function (such as COUNT, MAX, MIN, etc.).

In this case, the COUNT(*) function is used to count the number of rows in each group, 
and the result of this function is given an alias of "number_of_duplicates".
However, the HAVING clause does not refer to this alias. Instead, it refers to the function itself (i.e. COUNT(*)).
*/

```

Questions 1- 10

1. Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups.
   Show the total amount of patients in each weight group.
   Order the list by the weight group decending. e.g. if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group,
   etc.

```sql
SELECT (weight / 10) * 10 AS weight_group, COUNT(*) AS patients_in_this_weight_group
FROM patients
GROUP BY weight_group
ORDER BY weight_group DESC;
```

2. Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table. Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1. Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)
   . Weight is in units kg. Height is in units cm.

```sql
SELECT patient_id,
       weight,
       height,
       CASE
           WHEN weight / POWER(height / 100.00, 2) >= 30
               THEN 1
           ELSE 0
           END AS isobese
FROM patients;
-- we need to divide by 100.00 as if we divide int by int, the decimals will be truncated, ex: 100/3 = 33 BUT 100/3.0 = 33.333333333
```

3. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty.
   Show only the patients who has a diagnosis as 'Epilepsy' and the doctor's first name is 'Lisa'
   Check patients, admissions, and doctors tables for required information.

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, d.speciality
FROM patients p
         JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
         JOIN doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
WHERE a.diagnosis = 'Epilepsy'
  AND d.first_name = 'Lisa';
```

4. All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site. Those patients are given a temporary password after
   their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.

   The password must be the following, in order:
    - patient_id
    - the numerical length of patient's last_name
    - year of patient's birth_date

```sql
--PostgreSQL
SELECT DISTINCT p.patient_id, CONCAT(a.patient_id, LENGTH(p.last_name), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.birth_date)) AS temp_password
FROM patients p
         JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id;

--SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p.patient_id, CONCAT(a.patient_id, LENGTH(p.last_name), year(p.birth_date)) AS temp_password
FROM patients p
         JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id;
```

5. Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.
   Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance
   group.

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN a.patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_insurance,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 10 ELSE 50 END) AS cost_after_insurance
FROM admissions a
GROUP BY has_insurance;
```

6. Show the provinces that has more patients identified as 'M' than 'F'. Must only show full province_name

```sql
SELECT pr.province_name
FROM province_names pr
         JOIN patients p ON pr.province_id = p.province_id
GROUP BY province_name
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > SUM(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END);

/*
COUNT is used to count the number of rows that meet a certain criteria, 
while SUM is used to add up the values in a particular column for rows that meet a certain criteria.
*/
```

7. We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:

- First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.
- Identifies their gender as 'F'
- Born in February, May, or December
- Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg
- Their patient_id is an odd number
- They are from the city 'Kingston'

```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE first_name SIMILAR TO '^[a-zA-Z]{2}r'
  AND gender = 'F'
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM (birth_date)) IN (2, 5, 12)
  AND weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';

-- SQL
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE first_name LIKE '__r%' --first_name LIKE '^[a-zA-Z]{2}r'
  AND gender = 'F'
  AND month(birth_date) IN (2, 5, 12)
  AND weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';

```

8. Show the percent of patients that have 'M' as their gender. Round the answer to the nearest hundreth number and in percent form.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2), '%')
FROM patients;

SELECT ROUND(100 * AVG(gender = 'M'), 2) || '%' AS percent_of_male_patients
FROM patients;
```

9. For each day display the total amount of admissions on that day. Display the amount changed from the previous date.

```sql
WITH temp_table AS (SELECT admission_date,
                           COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
                    FROM admissions
                    GROUP BY admission_date
                    ORDER BY admission_date DESC)
SELECT admission_date,
       total_admissions,
       total_admissions - LAG(total_admissions, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date DESC) AS change
FROM temp_table;

-- Alternative 
SELECT admission_date,
       COUNT(admission_date)                                                             AS admission_day,
       COUNT(admission_date) - LAG(COUNT(admission_date)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS admission_count_change
FROM admissions
GROUP BY admission_date;
```

10. Sort the province names in ascending order in such a way that the province 'Ontario' is always on top.

```sql
WITH temp_table AS (SELECT province_name FROM province_names ORDER BY (province_name = 'Ontario') DESC, province_name ASC)
SELECT province_name
FROM temp_table;

/*
This query uses a combination of the ORDER BY clause and a boolean expression to prioritize the 'Ontario' record.
The boolean expression (name = 'Ontario') returns TRUE for the 'Ontario' record and FALSE for all other records.
When this expression is used in the ORDER BY clause with the DESC keyword, it causes the 'Ontario' record to be sorted first in the resulting dataset.
The rest of the records are then sorted in ascending order by the name column.
*/
```

11. We need a breakdown for the total amount of admissions each doctor has started each year. Show the doctor_id, doctor_full_name, specialty, year, total_admissions for that year.

```sql
SELECT d.doctor_id, CONCAT(d.first_name,' ',d.last_name) AS doctor_full_name,
		 d.specialty,
       YEAR(a.admission_date) AS selected_year,
       COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
FROM admissions a
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
GROUP BY doctor_id, selected_year
```
